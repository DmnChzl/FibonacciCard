# Fibonacci Card 🃏

> 1.1.1

I made a simple and colorful application (#ForTheLulz) based on the **Fibonnaci** sequence, for all your user stories (random) evaluation in a **Scrum** process.

This app is powered by [SvelteJS](https://svelte.dev/).

### Tips

Try to reduce the **Fibonnaci** sequence using `urlSearchParam` :
- [fibonacci-card.vercel.app/?limit=55](https://fibonacci-card.vercel.app/?limit=55)
- 
Try the "_script_" mode using `urlSearchParam` :
- [fibonacci-card.vercel.app/?mode=script](https://fibonacci-card.vercel.app/?mode=script)
